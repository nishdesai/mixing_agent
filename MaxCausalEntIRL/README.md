# Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Python implementation of Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning from Brian Ziebart's PhD thesis (2010): http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bziebart/publications/thesis-bziebart.pdf

Main file: MaxCausalEnt.py

Work in progress. Current TODOs:
1) Boltzmann policy value iteration: initialize with V = reward
