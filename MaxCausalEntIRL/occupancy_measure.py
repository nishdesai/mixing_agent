def compute_D(mdp, gamma, policy, P_0=None, t_max=None, threshold=1e-6):
    '''
    Computes occupancy measure of a MDP under a given time-constrained policy 
    -- the expected discounted number of times that policy Ï€ visits state s in 
    a given number of timesteps.
    
    Described in Algorithm 9.3 of Ziebart's PhD thesis 
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bziebart/publications/thesis-bziebart.pdf.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mdp : object
        Instance of the MDP class.
    gamma : float 
        Discount factor; 0<=gamma<=1.
    policy : 2D numpy array
        policy[s,a] is the probability of taking action a in state s.
    P_0 : 1D numpy array of shape (mdp.nS)
        i-th element is the probability that the traj will start in state i.
    t_max : int
        number of timesteps the policy is executed.

    Returns
    -------
    1D numpy array of shape (mdp.nS)
